title: Prepare Quarantined Hardware
---

1. Separate your quarantined hardware into two parallel sets. Each set should contain:
  - One laptop
  - Two USB drives from the same manufacturer

    Each component should be supplied by *different* manufacturers from the other set.
    I.e. your two laptops should be from two different manufacturers, and the USB
    drives in one set should be from a different manufacturer than the USB drives in
    the other set.

1. In each set, label all hardware with a permanent marker. Write directly on
the hardware:

    1. Label the laptops ("Quarantined Computers") "Q1" and "Q2".
    1. Label one USB drive from each set with <span class="qboot">Q1 BOOT</span> or <span class="qboot">Q2 BOOT</span>.
    These USBs will have the operating system you'll boot the computer
    with.
    1. Label the other USB drive from each set with <span class="qapp">Q1 APP</span> or <span class="qapp">Q2 APP</span>. These
    USBs will have the software applications you'll use.

1. **Labeled hardware should <span style="color:red">only</span> be used with
   hardware that shares the same label ("Q1", "Q2", or "SETUP 1", or
   "SETUP 2").** For example:

    1. **Don't** plug a **"Q1"** USB drive into a **"Q2"** laptop.
    1. **Don't** plug a **"SETUP 2"** USB drive into a **"Q1"** or **"Q2"** laptop.
    1. **Don't** plug an **unlabeled** USB drive into a **"Q1"** or **"Q2"** laptop.

1. Quarantine the network and wireless interfaces for both laptops:

    1. Unbox laptop. Do **not** power it on.
    1. Put a [tamper-resistant seal](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Warranty-Hologram-Sequential-Numbering/dp/B0051JNB6A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471760406&sr=8-1&keywords=tamper+resistant+stickers)
       over the Ethernet port, if it has one.
    1. Physically remove the wireless card.

        1. For the recommended Dell laptop, Dell's official instructions for
        doing so are [here](http://topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/inspiron-11-3162-laptop_Service%20Manual_en-us.pdf).
        A YouTube video showing an abbreviated procedure is
        [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFYXQQPoh90).
        1. For the recommended Acer laptop, the process is similar to the Dell.
        Note there are two cover screws hidden underneath rubber feet on the
        bottom of the laptop.

    1. After removing the wireless card, cover the ends of the internal wi-fi
    antennae with electrical tape.
    1. If the computer has separate cards for WiFi and Bluetooth, be sure to
    remove both. (Most modern laptops, including the recommended Acer and Dell,
    have a single wireless card which handles both.)

1. Fully charge both laptops.
