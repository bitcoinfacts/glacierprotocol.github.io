Glacier is a step-by-step protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure
manner. It is intended for:

* **Personal storage**: Glacier does not address institutional security
needs such as internal controls, transparent auditing, and preventing access
to funds by a single individual.
* **Large amounts of money ($100,000+)**: Glacier thoroughly considers corner
cases such as obscure vectors for malware infection, personal estate
planning, human error resulting in loss of funds, and so on.
Even if your Bitcoin holdings are more modest, it's worth considering using
Glacier. If Bitcoin proves successful as a global currency, it will appreciate
10x (or much more) in the coming years. Security will become increasingly
important if your holdings appreciate and Bitcoin becomes a more attractive
target for thieves.
The "Protocol Overview" section also describes some lower-security, lower-cost
approaches to self-managed storage that may be more appropriate for smaller
amounts of funds.
* **Long-term storage**: Glacier not only considers the Bitcoin security
landscape today, but also a future world where Bitcoin is much more valuable
and attracts many more security threats.
* **Infrequently-accessed funds**: Accessing highly secure bitcoins is
cumbersome and introduces security risk through the possibility of human
error, so it is best done infrequently.
* **Technically unskilled users**: Although the Glacier protocol is long, it is
clear and straightforward to follow. No technical expertise is required.

The Glacier protocol covers bitcoin storage, not procurement. It assumes you
already possess bitcoins and wish to store them more securely.

If you are already familiar with Bitcoin security concepts and are certain that
you want high security cold storage, you may prefer to read
