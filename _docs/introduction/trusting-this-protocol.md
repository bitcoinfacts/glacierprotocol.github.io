title: Trusting This Protocol
---

Funds secured using Glacier can only be as secure as its design.
Here's what you can trust about this protocol:
* **Expert advisors**: The development of Glacier was guided with input from
Bitcoin technology and security experts. See our advisor list.
* **Open source**: GlacierScript, the Glacier companion software, is open
source. The code is straightforward and well-commented to facilitate easy review
for flaws or vulnerabilities. [View it on Github](https://github.com/bitcoinfacts/GlacierProtocol).
* **Community review**: The protocol has evolved in conjunction with the wider
Bitcoin community. Early versions were circulated during development, and
community feedback integrated. [See our list of contributors](/docs/contribute/acknowledgments/).
* **Natural selection**: All documentation and code related to this protocol is
under open licenses (Creative Commons for the document, MIT license for the
code), enabling others to publish their own revisions. Inferior alternatives
will tend to lose popularity over time.
